# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application follows a modular JavaScript architecture with separate classes handling different concerns:

- **ThemeManager**: Handles light/dark theme switching with localStorage persistence
- **NavigationManager**: Manages client-side routing and page navigation
- **Canvas API Integration**: Utilizes HTML5 Canvas for client-side image processing and format conversion

The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with a class-based structure to maintain clean separation of concerns. No frontend frameworks are used, keeping the application lightweight and fast-loading.

## Styling System
The CSS architecture uses CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent theming:

- **Theme Support**: Dual light/dark theme system with CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Typography System**: Consistent spacing and font sizing using CSS variables
- **Component-Based Styling**: Modular CSS structure for reusable components

The application implements a comprehensive content architecture for SEO:

- **Blog System**: 20 pre-planned articles targeting long-tail keywords related to image conversion
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and Schema markup

## Client-Side Processing
All image conversion happens locally in the user's browser:

Single-page application (SPA) approach with client-side routing:
